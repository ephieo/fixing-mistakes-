    <h5 > RESPONSIVENESS & PLAYING WITH FLEX </h5>
   
    <p > I initially struggled with making my website mobile responsive. I mainly struggled with media queries and how to apply them, so I played around with flexbox using empty coloured divs and loren ipsum text to visually see the changes I made.My main struggle with media queries was visually seeing the effects of my changes when working. Also I made the mistake of not making my code responsive as I go along, it was more of an afterthought, when it should have been a step by step practice.  </p>
    <h5> LOOKING INTO REM AND EM UNITS</h5>
    <p> I experimented with using units other than pixels. 
        I wanted to experiment with rem  because it alongside em seemed like the most complicated CSS unit. 
        I also learnt more about the difference between absolute and relative units, although I would like to practice using fr alongside flex box in the future. </p>
    <h5> WORKING WITH GRAPHICS</h5>
    <p>I also tried to combine my photoshop graphics with working with  background image styling and trying to create a more cohesive page. I picked images from Pinterest and recreated them in photoshop and then attempted to make the page seem like it flows from one destination to another. </p>

    <div class="greentwoone">
        <p class="circle-text"> I struggled a lot with figuring out how to implement keyboard navigation and how to make the carousel pause. While reading up more on event listeners and DOM manipulation I managed to achieve it by creating an if statement while using the events keycode, mouseleave and mouseenter. I found the book “JavaScript and JQuery: Interactive Front-End Web Development” by Jon Duckett to be quite helpful, just my luck that it arrived the day after the application submissions. Although there are  some limitations to the book seeing as it was published the year that ES6 was released so some things are either outdated or not mentioned. 
            Nonetheless I found it quite helpful for understanding the basics of nodelists, the DOM tree etc.. </p>

    <div class="greentwotwo">
    <p class="circle-text">I also struggled with which method to use to create the carousel. 
        I watched many videos about how people attempted creating a slideshow but many didn’t use vanilla javascript or only achieved parts of the carousel requisites. 
        My aim was to find a method that I could replicate and understand. 
        I initially approached the task by ordering my slides into an array and iterating through the array by moving a distance of slide width while using click events. However with the array approach I couldn’t figure out how to loop the carousel so I used a clone approach. 
        Using the cloneNode method I created a first and last clone place them at the beginning and end of my slides list and looped through the slides by using setInterval and the transitionend event. Once the transition ended I could then return it to the first or last clone. </p>

            <p class="cube-text"> I found Codecademy to be a better resource to reinforce the knowledge  I learnt from FreeCodeCamp. It’s interface was more similar to other code editors. I spent my time slowly working through the Codecademy ‘Intro to JavaScript’ course to just practice the basics and gain a greater understanding.

            <h3 class="cube-title"> CODEWARS</h3>
           <p class="cube-texttwo">I worked through some problems that I completed with help from YouTube and other resources to try and understand them on my own. I struggled with code wars the most, I often felt like I was more or less just copying code and not really understanding. I found that I struggled more with mathematical katas than fundamental katas. It’s just an area that I’ll just have to just keep practicing as time goes on. However I did find some problems easier after going through Codecademy.</p>

           <p class="cube-texttwo">overall my biggest lesson from this experince is that I have a long way to go and require a lot of commitment. However I'm more than excited about what I can learn as I navigate through this coding journey.</p>
